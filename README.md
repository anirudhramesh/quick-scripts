# quick-scripts
Short scripts written to do quick tasks (mostly on Windows, but cross platform if on Python). Requires python knowledge to edit and use for your own purposes.

File rename - quickly rename all files in a directory using defined rules.

File splitter - uses pandas' built in functionality to split very large files and store them according to given rules. Uses the multiprocessing modules to significantly speed up the process by parallelising it.

excel writer modules - codify pandas' writing and editing to excel by wrapping extended functionality from xlsxwriter or openpyxl into single function calls.

csv to sqlite3 - use pandas' sql capabilities to dynamically write large csv's into sqlite databases. vastly increases functionality since you can query it.
